### CLI

Command Line Interface. A text-based way to interact with software (like this tool!).

### Context Window

The amount of text an AI can consider at once. Like a desk that can only hold so much. When you add files, conversation history, and system prompts, they all take up space in this window.

### Conventional Commit

A commit message format that follows a standardized structure: `type(scope): description`. Common types include `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), `refactor`, and `test`. Example: `feat(auth): add password reset flow`.

### Skill
